question :

Imagine there is 100 pieces of paper in a hat, labelled from 1 to 100. Two pieces of
papers choosen at random. The smaller number is subtracted from the larger number
and the answer is written on a new piece of paper. This number is placed back in the hat
and the two original numbers discarded. The process is repeats until one number is left.

What can you say about the final number left in the hat? Would that be a smaller number
or a bigger number. Let's define if the number is smaller than mid point(less than 50 in case of 1 to 100),
then we call it a smaller number and if its larger than the mid point(more than 50 in case of 1 to 100),
we call it a larger number.

your job is to write a simulator for this game. Write a function that takes two arguments:
first one is the max number N and second argument is how many times the simulation must run.
The output can be the winning number for each simulation run and at the end, what percentage of times
a smaller number won and what percentage of time a larger number won.
