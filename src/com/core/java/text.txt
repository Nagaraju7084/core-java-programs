When a lion was resting in the jungle, a mouse began racing up and down his body for amusement. The lion’s sleep was interrupted, and he awoke enraged. The lion was going to eat the mouse when the mouse begged him to let him go. “I assure you, if you save me, I will be of immense help to you in the future.” The lion laughed at the mouse’s self-assurance and freed him.
